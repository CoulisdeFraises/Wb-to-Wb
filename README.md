[VBA] Copy data from a closed workbook to another

I wrote thsi code so that I could chose data from another workbook, formerly closed, and then copy it to an already opened one.
The opened one has the commands on the first sheet, and the pested data will be on she second sheet.

This is pretty basic.

It is supposed to copy a full column, with blanc cells
I messed with e few ways to do this in the code but i'm trying to get the cleanest/safest way to do it. And make it work as a function or sub that can be called
multiple time so that the code is shorter, simplifying it.

This is my first experience with VBA.
And I'm new to coding :)
